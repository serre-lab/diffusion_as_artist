        Each n-shot task contains a "support set" of `k` sets of `n` samples and a "query set" of `k` sets
        of `q` samples. The support set and the query set are all grouped into one Tensor such that the first n * k
        samples are from the support set while the remaining q * k samples are from the query set.

        The support and query sets are sampled such that they are disjoint i.e. do not contain overlapping samples.

        # Arguments
            dataset: Instance of torch.utils.data.Dataset from which to draw samples
            episodes_per_epoch: Arbitrary number of batches of n-shot tasks to generate in one epoch
            n_shot: int. Number of samples for each class in the n-shot classification tasks.
            k_way: int. Number of classes in the n-shot classification tasks.
            q_queries: int. Number query samples for each class in the n-shot classification tasks.
            num_tasks: Number of n-shot tasks to group into a single batch
            fixed_tasks: If this argument is specified this Sampler will always generate tasks from
                the specified classes
